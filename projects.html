I was technical director, responsible for programming the site, and we came first place overall.

I was an early adopter of Windows 10, I had it installed the week it came out and more recently I built my own PC (I know this isn't strictly Windows, but it runs on Windows so I thought I'd mention it).</p>

The idea that I can run an operating system that was written by hundreds of thousands of people from all over the world and I can then go and look at the source for said operating system is something I think is really cool (although I do wish software compatibility for it was a lot higher, if it was I would probably make it my main OS). So far, I have played with Ubuntu (vanilla and Kubuntu), Manjaro (KDE Manjaro) and a little bit of Kali. I also have some experience with Android rooting and modding, not a whole lot and I don't do it anymore since it can mess with the hardware really badly, and if you're without your phone then you're kind of stuck in today's world. <small>(At least, I am!)</small></p>

Converting files to a readable Mac format, playing around with incompatible file system etc were all part of the job. Recently, I was given a Macbook as my work PC and since then I have learnt more about how to navigate and use macOS more efficiently. Hacking around with the system also made me realise how close the shell is to Linux, using the terminal in macOS was very familiar due to my previous experiences.</p>

                        <p>The EA Windband taught me how to be a better musician, and how to work as part of a large group to put on a production. It also taught me how to coordinate with other people, as you have to listen to cues and signals from both the conductor and other members of the band in order to know when you are supposed to play. I was given a lot of great opportunities here: I have played in competitions, played for the Council of Europe and in a massive shopping mall. I really enjoyed my time in the Youth Wind Band!</p>
