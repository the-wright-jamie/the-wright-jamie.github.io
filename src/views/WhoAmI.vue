        Once upon a time, a human being figured out how to imbue rocks with the power of
        electricity. Building upon the discoveries of those who came before them, they taught this
        rock how to think, to compute, and to connect with other supercharged rocks across the

      <p>I'm a security and software engineer from Northern Ireland.</p>

      <p>
        <span class="italic">"What exactly is a security AND software engineer?"</span>, I hear you
        ask.
      </p>

      <p>
        Well, by light, I help to ensure the security of the project I oversee by building tooling,
        monitoring infrastructure and security testing - security engineering. By night, I build,
        design and consult with clients to create bespoke software solutions and applications -
        software engineering. In between all that, I try to find the time for various creative and
        mind expanding pursuits of which include: game making, learning, music and general knowledge
        acquisition.
      </p>
      <p>
        I consider myself to be a results-driven engineer. I have 6 years of industry experience in
        software development, infrastructure management, and security engineering. I have enhanced
        the security of projects I've worked on by developing custom tooling, monitoring
        infrastructure on AWS, helping to ensure SOC2 compliance and performing informal penetration
        testing. I'm a big believer in the idea that 'the impossible just takes a little longer'.
      </p>

        What follows here is a <span class="font-extrabold">subjective recount</span> of my life as
        it pertains to my interest in technology and my professional career. A more objective, fact
        based recount of my career can be found at

      <h2>Professional Career</h2>
      <img

      />
      <p>
        In 2019, I began my professional career as an Apprentice Software Engineer at Kainos. Over
        the course of my apprenticeship, I gained experience in a variety of technologies and soft
        skills.
      </p>

      <img
        class="shadow-xl/50 block mx-auto md:float-left md:mr-6 mb-4 md:mb-0 h-64 md:h-72 rounded-2xl"
        src="../assets/img/uni-start.jpg"
      />

      <p>
        At the same time, I started university. As part of my apprenticeship, I was going to
        university on Mondays and working at Kainos for the rest of the work week. In order to get
        uni coursework done, and avoid burning out at work, I had to develop careful time management
        skills.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2022, I moved roles at Kainos from a software engineer to a security engineer. Since my
        time there, I have learned...
      </p>
      <p>
        For my university final year honours project, I created an Android application written in
        Kotlin and Jetpack Compose (a newly released technology at the time), and wrote the backend
        API for it in Express. A central API was planned so that it could be used across all sorts
        of interfaces, and allow other applications to use it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had wanted to give myself a challenge, so I had to learn Kotlin and Jetpack Compose
        uniquely for this project. The project was aimed to be a 'Google Maps' or 'TripAdvisor' for
        people with disabilities of all kinds. The data was intended to be crowdsourced, so users
        would be able to search for a location and review what other users had to say about it and
        if it had key features for accessibility, such as usable ramps or quiet spaces. I also
        learnt a lot about accessibility within UI/UX and the importance of such during this
        project. I finished this project in 2023, and was rewarded with a first class for my
        honours.
      </p>

        src="../assets/img/graduation.jpg"
      />
      <p>
        I graduated university in 2023 achieving a First Class Honours, Bachelors of Science in
        Computing Systems. After that, I was offered to remain at Kainos and was promoted to full
        time Assosiate Security Engineer.
      </p>

      <p>In 2024, I started my largest solo project in Kainos to date. This was Lifeline.</p>

      <p>
        Since its completion, Lifeline has helped me stay ahead of new releases and helped my team
        plan ahead of dependency deprecations, saving us from having to frantically update
        dependencies and ensure that we rarely have to do major renovations or overhaul. While that
        may have a maintenance impact in the short term, compared to previous renovations we've had
        to do it has saved us countless hours in the long term.

      <p>
        I enjoy messing about with technology. The related image for this section shows the 3DS that
        I hacked in order to run custom firmware. I also enjoy learning how computers work. When I
        have time, I enjoy learning Linux, experimenting with different programming languages, etc.
      </p>

      <img
        class="shadow-xl/50 block mx-auto md:float-right md:ml-6 mb-4 md:mb-0 w-64 md:w-72 rounded-2xl"

      />
      <p>
        REPLACE THIS: I also enjoy building computers. The related image for this section shows a
        computer that I built from parts that I sourced myself. I enjoy the challenge of picking out
        compatible parts, and the satisfaction of seeing it all come together and work at the end.
        I've used this computer to learn a lot about Linux and programming. I also used it to do
        video editing for a charity on a voulunteer basis. I was able to learn a lot about video
        editing and production through this experience.

      <h2>Early Days</h2>

      />
      <p>
        At the risk of sounding like a cliche, I have had a passion for computers since before I can
        remember. Some of my earliest memories include being able to type on my Granddad's Windows
        98 PC before being able to properly read and write, playing Need for Speed on the Xbox, and
        messing about with Flight Simulators with my dad on his Windows XP laptop (see picture).
        REPLACE THIS: I was always fascinated by how these machines worked, and would often try to
        take them apart to see what was inside. My parents were always supportive of my interests,
        and would often buy me books and magazines about computers and technology. I remember
        getting a magazine called 'Computer Shopper' that had a section on building your own PC. I
        was hooked from then on. I would spend hours reading about different components and how they
        worked together.

      <h2>School Awards, Accomplishments and Interests</h2>
      <p>
        2014. The year before I started my GCSEs, my school held a website building competition that
        the whole school year took part in. I lead my team, helping them to come up with ideas and
        guiding them in HTML, CSS and JS programming. The competition was judged by teachers as well
        as representatives from local technology companies. Under my leadership, I was able to get
        us to first place.

      <p>
        2017. I attended an event ran by Kainos called Code Camp. This is one of the bigger evens
        that happen in Belfast usually with close to and often over 100 attendants. The first week
        involved learning more about website design and engineering (with other lectures involved to
        learn more about the software world), and the second week involved a competition to create a
        website. This was a solo effort. After a lot of work-shopping and prototyping, I manged to
        create something that managed to get me to third place (see picture). The code for this
        website was
        <a class="underline" href="https://github.com/the-wright-jamie/Kainos-CodeCamp-2018"
          >uploaded to and archived on my GitHub profile</a

      />
      <p>
        I was also involve in various other extra curricular activities - I was a senior member of
        the sound and lighting team (see picture). As part of this, I lead teams to deliver
        behind-the-scenes services to various events that happened in the school, from regular
        events like assemblies to one-offs like award nights, discos and public drama performances.
        I was also responsible for training and introducing new team members, getting them ready to
        help serve the school in their own way. I was also a member of the school choir and
        orchestra, working my way from lower desks all the way to first desk.

        I took part in the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme, achieving my Gold Award in 2018. I
        achieved all three levels, Bronze, Silver and Gold.
