        Once upon a time, a human being figured out how to imbue rocks with the power of
        electricity. Building upon the discoveries of those who came before them, they taught this
        rock how to think, to compute, and to connect with other supercharged rocks across the
        globe.

      <p>I'm a security and software engineer from Northern Ireland.</p>

      <p>
        <span class="italic">"What exactly is a security AND software engineer?"</span>, I hear you
        ask.
      </p>

      <p>
        Well, by light, I help to ensure the security of the project I oversee by building tooling,
        monitoring infrastructure and security testing - security engineering. By night, I build,
        design and consult with clients to create bespoke software solutions and applications -
        software engineering. In between all that, I try to find the time for various creative and
        mind expanding pursuits of which include: game making, learning, music and general knowledge
        acquisition.

      <h2>Professional Career</h2>
      <p>
        In 2019, I began my professional career as an Apprentice Software Engineer at Kainos. Over
        the course of my apprenticeship, I gained experience in a variety of technologies and

        src="../assets/img/uni-start.jpg"
      />

      <p>
        At the same time, I started university. As part of my apprenticeship, I was going to
        university on Mondays and working at Kainos for the rest of the work week. In order to get
        uni coursework done, and avoid burning out at work, I had to develop careful time management
        skills.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2022, I moved roles at Kainos from a software engineer to a security engineer. Since my
        time there, I have learned...

      <p>I graduated university in 2023. After that, I moved to working at Kainos full time.</p>

      <p>
        I enjoy messing about with technology. The related image for this section shows the 3DS that
        I hacked in order to run custom firmware. I also enjoy learning how computers work. When I
        have time, I enjoy learning Linux, experimenting with different programming languages, etc.

      <p>
        At the risk of sounding like a cliche, I have had a passion for computers since before I can
        remember. Some of my earliest memories include being able to type on my Granddad's Windows
        98 PC before being able to properly read and write, playing Need for Speed on the Xbox, and
        messing about with Flight Simulators with my dad on his Windows XP laptop (see picture).

      <h2>School Awards, Accomplishments and Interests</h2>
      <p>
        2014. The year before I started my GCSEs, my school held a website building competition that
        the whole school year took part in. I lead my team, helping them to come up with ideas and
        guiding them in HTML, CSS and JS programming. The competition was judged by teachers as well
        as representatives from local technology companies. Under my leadership, I was able to get
        us to first place.

      <p>
        2017. I attended an event ran by Kainos called Code Camp. This is one of the bigger evens
        that happen in Belfast usually with close to and often over 100 attendants. The first week
        involved learning more about website design and engineering (with other lectures involved to
        learn more about the software world), and the second week involved a competition to create a
        website. This was a solo effort. After a lot of work-shopping and prototyping, I manged to
        create something that managed to get me to third place (see picture). The code for this
        website was
        <a class="underline" href="https://github.com/the-wright-jamie/Kainos-CodeCamp-2018"
          >uploaded to and archived on my GitHub profile</a

      <p>
        I was also involve in various other extra curricular activities - I was a senior member of
        the sound and lighting team (see picture), as well as a member of the school choir and
        orchestra. I also took part in the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme, achieving my Gold Award
        in 2018. All of these activities helped me to develop a range of skills, from teamwork and
        leadership to technical expertise and creativity.

      <p>I completed my Duke of Ed in 2018. I achived all three levels, Bronze, Silver and Gold.</p>
